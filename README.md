# Docsphin

**Private file tools that never leave your browser.**

Merge, organise and shrink PDFs, add page numbers, a watermark or a password,
turn a Word file or a spreadsheet into a PDF and back, and tidy a messy
spreadsheet. Nothing is uploaded.

## What this is

Everyday document tools, in one place, free and without an account:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [PDF Tools](src/app/tools/pdf-tools/page.tsx) | Merge PDFs and reorder their pages; organise one by rotating, deleting, duplicating and reordering pages or adding blank ones; extract pages as PDFs, or save them as JPG or PNG images; compress, with a quality slider or to fit under a size limit such as 200 KB; add page numbers or a text watermark; add a password (AES-256) or remove a known one (and the printing and copying restrictions) with qpdf; and build a PDF from images. Lay out a .docx as a PDF &mdash; headings, lists, tables, pictures, headers and footers &mdash; or print a workbook to PDF with the column widths, merged cells and repeating header row intact. Also the other way: a PDF into an editable Word document, or the tables in a PDF into an Excel spreadsheet |
| [Spreadsheet Tools](src/app/tools/spreadsheet-tools/page.tsx) | Detects the text encoding and separator, finds the real header row, removes duplicate and blank rows, strips invisible characters, normalises inconsistent date formats, clusters equivalent spellings for review, reports what cleaning cannot fix, shows every changed cell with per-row rescue, and cleans every sheet of a workbook |

The [Image Tools](src/app/tools/image-tools/page.tsx) and [Developer Tools](src/app/tools/developer-tools/page.tsx) are hidden from the site while Docsphin focuses on documents. Their pages still work at their old links, and the code is unchanged:

| Hidden tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [Image Tools](src/app/tools/image-tools/page.tsx) | Passport photos: detects the face and the top of the hair, crops to the exact size and head height a document requires (UK, US, Schengen, India, Australia, Canada and the ICAO standards), flags what would get the photo rejected, and lays copies out on a 6 x 4, 7 x 5 or A4 print with cut marks. Also batch compress and resize JPEG, PNG and WebP, or cut the subject out of a photo and save it with a transparent or solid-colour background |
| [Developer Tools](src/app/tools/developer-tools/page.tsx) | Convert between JSON, CSV and YAML with nesting flattened to dot-notation columns and back; a live Markdown editor exporting to standalone HTML or PDF with themes; diff checker, case converter, whitespace cleaner and Base64 / URL / JWT encoding |

No sign-up, no email wall, no file size caps, no paywalled features. Every tool is complete.

## Works with no internet

Because every tool already runs in the browser, there is nothing left that needs a connection
except the site itself. So your browser keeps a copy of it: visit once, and after that the pages,
styling and code load from your own machine rather than the network. About 7 MB.

How far that goes is up to the browser, not to us. Chrome and Edge offer a real install, and it
then sits with your other apps. Some browsers offer only a home-screen shortcut, which opens the
site but is not an installed app &mdash; Brave does this deliberately, because a real install on
Android means fetching a package from Google. Others, Firefox on the desktop among them, offer
nothing at all. On an iPhone it is Share, then Add to Home Screen.

The models and qpdf are not part of that 7 MB &mdash; they are fetched the first time
you use the tool that needs them, and kept from then on, so a tool you have used online once works
offline afterwards and one you never have does not.

When a new version is published your browser fetches it and offers a Reload. That matters: without
it, a saved copy would keep people on an old version with no way to send them a fix.

## The "no upload" part

This is the whole point, so it is worth being precise about what it means.

Conventional online converters work by **uploading your file to a server**, processing it there and
sending the result back. That means your spreadsheet of customer records, your scanned contract or
your private photos land on a machine you do not control, subject to a retention policy you did not
read.

Docsphin does the processing in **the page you already have open**. When you drop a file onto a tool,
the browser reads it into memory with the standard `File` API and the conversion runs in JavaScript
on your own machine. The result is handed back to you as an in-memory blob. There is no upload step
because there is no server to upload to — the whole site is static files.

**You can verify this yourself**, and you should not take our word for it:

- Open your browser's developer tools, switch to the Network tab, and use any tool. You will not
  see your file go anywhere.
- Load the site, turn off your Wi-Fi, and keep using it. Your browser keeps a copy of the
  site after the first visit, so it opens and runs with no connection at all.
- Read the source. Every tool's page links directly to its own source file.

What this approach genuinely costs you: very large files are limited by your device's memory rather
than by a server's, and PDF compression is weaker than what a server-side tool like Ghostscript can
manage. We would rather be honest about that trade-off than quietly take your documents.

### Enforced, not just promised

The app ships a [Content-Security-Policy](src/app/layout.tsx) with `connect-src 'self'` and
`form-action 'none'`. The browser itself then refuses any attempt to send data to another origin,
so the no-upload guarantee does not rest on trusting the code — or on every future contributor
getting it right. If a dependency ever tried to phone home, the request would simply be blocked.

### What is *not* collected

No analytics, no tracking pixels, no cookies, no error reporting service, no fonts or scripts
fetched from a third-party CDN at runtime. The support button is a plain outbound link to a page
the payment company hosts, rather than an embedded widget, so no payment code ever runs on a page
that is handling your files.

The only data stored at all is in your own browser: your light/dark theme preference, the Markdown
editor's draft so a refresh does not lose your work, and a flag recording that you dismissed the
donation message. All of it is in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` on your device and none of it is
ever transmitted.

## Tech stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 15** (App Router) with a fully static export — no server runtime
- **TypeScript** in strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS**, themed with CSS variables for light and dark modes
- Processing libraries, all running client-side and loaded on demand:
  [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/), [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/),
  [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml),
  [browser-image-compression](https://github.com/Donaldcwl/browser-image-compression),
  [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/), [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/),
  [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/), [marked](https://marked.js.org/),
  [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify),
  [jsdiff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff),
  [onnxruntime-web](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)

Because the output is a static site with no serverless functions, hosting it costs nothing on
Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify or GitHub Pages, and stays free regardless of traffic.

## Running it locally

Requires Node.js 18.18 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarkhailstorm/docsphin.git
cd docsphin
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

| Script | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Produce the static site in `out/` |
| `npm run start` | Serve the built `out/` directory locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting |
| `npm run lint` | Lint |

### A note on the SheetJS dependency

`xlsx` is installed from `https://cdn.sheetjs.com/...` rather than from npm. This is deliberate and
is [SheetJS's own documented installation method](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/getting-started/installation/nodejs/).
The `xlsx` package published on npm is frozen at an old version with unpatched prototype-pollution
and ReDoS advisories, which matters a great deal here because this app parses spreadsheets that
users supply. The vendor CDN serves the current, patched release.

### The pdf.js worker

`npm install` and `npm run build` copy the pdf.js worker from `node_modules` into `public/` via
`scripts/copy-pdf-worker.mjs`, so it is served from this site's own origin instead of a CDN. That
keeps the no-third-party-requests promise intact and lets the PDF tools work offline.

### Models and qpdf

Two tools need files that are far too big to put in a JavaScript bundle: the models in
`public/models/`, the browser runtime that runs them in `public/ort/`, and qpdf in
`public/qpdf/`.

| File | Used by | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modnet-*.onnx` | Cut-outs of people, and the top of the head for passport photos | Apache-2.0 |
| `u2netp-*.onnx` | Cut-outs of anything that is not a person | Apache-2.0 |
| `yunet-*.onnx` | Finding the face and the eyes, for passport photos | MIT |
| `qpdf-*.wasm` | Putting a password on a PDF, or taking a known one off | Apache-2.0 |

The ONNX runtime and qpdf are copied out of `node_modules` by `scripts/copy-onnx-runtime.mjs` and
`scripts/copy-qpdf.mjs`, exactly as the pdf.js worker is, and are not committed. The models **are**
committed, because they come from other people's servers rather than from npm, and a build should
not break the day one of those servers goes away. `scripts/fetch-models.mjs` fetches them once and
checks the byte count and SHA-256 of each; `scripts/copy-qpdf.mjs` checks qpdf's the same way. See
[THIRD-PARTY-LICENCES.md](THIRD-PARTY-LICENCES.md).

None of it is fetched when the site loads, and the downloads are shared: `src/lib/assets.ts` holds
one Cache Storage entry per file, so a visitor who has already cut a person out of a photo pays
only for the 232 KB face detector when they make a passport photo, and qpdf is fetched only by
someone who actually protects or unlocks a PDF.

## Deploying

The build produces a plain static site, so any static host works.

**Vercel** — import the repository; the defaults are correct, and it will detect Next.js.

**Cloudflare Pages / Netlify** — build command `npm run build`, output directory `out`.

**GitHub Pages** — `npm run build`, then publish `out/`. If you deploy to a project subpath rather
than a domain root, set `basePath` in [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs) to match.

## Configuration

Everything site-specific lives in one file: **[`config.ts`](config.ts)**.

Contributions are links out to a page the payment company hosts, so there is no server and no API
key in this repository. `support.routes` holds one entry per route:

```ts
export const support = {
  label: 'Donate',
  href: '/donate',
  routes: [
    {
      id: 'world',
      url: 'https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/XXXX',
      title: 'Donate in US dollars',
      who: 'anywhere outside India',
      provider: 'PayPal',
      providerUrl: 'https://www.paypal.com',
      privacyUrl: 'https://www.paypal.com/uk/legalhub/privacy-full',
    },
    // ...
  ],
};
```

There are two because neither company reaches everyone: PayPal stopped handling payments inside
India in April 2021, and Razorpay does not offer international cards to an individual account.
Swap the array for a single entry if one provider covers your case.

The legal pages render from this array rather than hardcoding a company name, so changing provider
is a change in this one file. Empty the array and every donation link hides itself rather than
pointing at a dead page.

The same file holds the site name, URL, repository link and the tool registry that drives the
landing page and navigation. Set `hidden: true` on a tool to drop it from every listing, the
sitemap included, while its page keeps working for anyone with the old link.

## Support

Docsphin is free and open source, and every feature works without paying. If it saved you some time,
you are welcome to chip in via the support link in the footer — entirely optional, and nothing is
gated behind it.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Two rules matter more than the rest:

1. **Nothing may be uploaded.** Any change that sends user file content off the device will be
   rejected. That includes analytics and third-party runtime scripts.
2. **No feature gets paywalled.** Donations are a tip, not a subscription.

Beyond that: keep tools focused on one job, use the semantic theme tokens so dark mode keeps
working, and load heavy libraries with a dynamic `import()` so they stay out of the initial bundle.
