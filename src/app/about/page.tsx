      <h2>What Docsphin is</h2>
      <p>
        Docsphin is software: a web application that gives you free tools for everyday document
        work &mdash; PDFs, Word files and spreadsheets. There is
        nothing to install and nothing to sign up for. You open a page, drop in a file, and get the
        result back.
      </p>

      <h2>The tools</h2>
      <ul>
        {tools.map((tool) => (
          <li key={tool.id}>
            <strong>{tool.name}</strong> &mdash; {tool.blurb}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h2>What makes it different</h2>
      <p>
        Most free file tools on the web work the same way: you upload your file to a
        company&rsquo;s server, the work happens there, and the result comes back to you. That means
        handing your spreadsheet, your scanned document or your photos to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docsphin is built the other way round. All the code that does the work is ordinary
        JavaScript running inside your own browser, on your own machine, so{' '}
        <strong>your files are never uploaded</strong>. There is no server to upload them to: the
        site is a set of static files with no application code running behind it, and no database.
        That is also why there is no account &mdash; nothing here needs to know who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full detail, including the small number of things that do get saved in your browser and
        what our host can see, is set out on the <Link href="/privacy">Privacy page</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>Who runs it</h2>
      <p>
        Docsphin is built and maintained by {author.name}, an independent software developer, and
        has been online since {author.since}. It is a one-person project: there is no team, no
        investors and no company behind it.
      </p>
      {legalNameConfigured ? (
        <p>
          The business behind the site is <strong>{business.legalName}</strong>.
        </p>
      ) : null}

      <h2>Open source</h2>
      <p>
        The whole project is released under the MIT licence and the source code is public. You can
        read exactly how each tool handles a file, check that the privacy claims on this site are
        true, run your own copy, or reuse any part of it in your own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repository is at{' '}
        <a href={site.repo} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          {site.repo}
        </a>
        . Docsphin is copyright {author.since} {author.name}, released under the{' '}
        <a
          href={`${site.repo}/blob/${site.repoBranch}/LICENSE`}

      <h2>How it is paid for</h2>
      <p>
        This site is free and stays free. Nothing is sold here, nothing is locked behind a payment,
        and there are no adverts. The running costs are small because there is no server doing work
        for you, and the real cost is the developer&rsquo;s time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the tools have saved you some trouble, you are welcome to make a voluntary contribution
        towards that time. It is a gift, not a purchase: it buys no features, no support and no
        priority. The <Link href="/pricing">Pricing page</Link> sets out exactly what is free and
        what a contribution is.
      </p>
      {donationsConfigured ? (
        <p>
          Contributions are handled away from this site. {world.provider} takes them from{' '}
          {world.who}, in US dollars, and {india.provider} takes them from inside {india.who}, in
          rupees &mdash; neither one reaches everybody. Each is a page that provider hosts, so you
          leave this site to pay. Nothing is embedded here and no payment code runs on a page that is
          handling your files.
        </p>
      ) : (
        <p>
          There is no contribution page open at the moment. When one opens it will be a link out to a
          page the provider hosts, with nothing embedded here.
        </p>
