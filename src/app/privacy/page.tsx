      <h2>The short version</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your files are processed inside your browser. They are never uploaded to us.</li>
        <li>There is no account, no sign-up and no contact form.</li>
        <li>We run no analytics and set no cookies.</li>
        <li>
          Six things are saved in your own browser. They are named below. One is the text you
          type into the Markdown Converter. Two are copies of this site&rsquo;s own files: about
          7 MB so it opens with no internet connection, and up to about 27 MB more if you use
          every tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our host, Vercel, logs every request for the pages themselves &mdash; as every website
          host does.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What happens to your files</h2>
      <p>
        When you drop a file onto a tool, your browser reads it from your disk and hands it to the
        page. The work &mdash; merging a PDF, cleaning a spreadsheet, shrinking a photo &mdash;
        happens in that tab, using code that was downloaded to your device. The finished file is
        built in memory and passed to your browser&rsquo;s own download. There is nowhere to send a
        file to, because there is no server: the site is a set of static files.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a tool is open, your file stays in the tab&rsquo;s memory on purpose, so you can
        change a setting and run it again without picking the file a second time. When you close the
        tab, it is gone. We will not claim more than that: the browser releases that memory when it
        chooses, and nothing here overwrites or securely erases anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing does change in your files. The Image Compressor re-encodes each photo, and the
        copy it gives you has no EXIF data &mdash; so the camera details, and the GPS location if
        your photo carried one, are not in the compressed version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything you save is written to your own disk by your browser, exactly as with any other
        download.
      </p>

      <h2>What is stored on your device</h2>
      <p>
        Six things, all kept by your browser for this site alone. None of them is an identifier,
        and we cannot read any of them, because nothing is ever sent back to us.

        The last one is only written if a contributions link is switched
        on{donationsConfigured ? '' : ', which it is not at the moment'}. To remove all six, clear
        this site&rsquo;s data in your browser settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both caches hold our code rather than anything of yours. Once the Background Remover
        has downloaded the tool files it shows a link to remove them from this browser, which
        clears them for every tool that shares them.
      </p>

      <h3>Working without an internet connection, in plain terms</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The first time you visit, your browser saves a copy of this site so you can use it with
          no internet connection.
        </strong>{' '}
        Tools you have already used work too. A tool that still has files to download does not,
        until you open it once with a connection. That copy is the pages, the styling and the code
        &mdash; about 7 MB. It is the same
        thing you would have downloaded anyway to see the site; it is simply kept instead of
        being fetched again.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it does not hold is anything of yours. Your files never travel over the network in
        the first place: the browser reads them straight from your device into memory, so there is
        nothing for this to see, store or send. It does use the network &mdash; that is how it
        fetches the copy, and how it falls back when it has nothing saved &mdash; but only ever to
        this site, for this site&rsquo;s own files. It contains no name, number or anything else
        that could identify you.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it costs you is disk space, and a copy of this site sitting on the machine until you
        clear it. On a shared or public computer that is worth knowing, the same as the Markdown
        draft below. When we publish a change, your browser fetches the new version and offers you
        a Reload; the old copy is then deleted.
      </p>

      <h3>The Markdown draft, in plain terms</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Everything you type into the Markdown Converter is saved in your own browser, half a
          second after you stop typing, so that it is still there when you come back.
        </strong>{' '}
        It survives closing the tab, quitting the browser and restarting the computer. Pressing
        Clear in the editor and confirming removes it straight away. On a shared, work or public
        computer, the next person who opens this tool in that browser will see what you wrote.
        Clear the editor before you walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the tool files listed above, no other tool keeps anything between visits. No
        file name, file size or file content is written to storage anywhere, and the site sets no
        cookies and uses no database in your browser.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>
        The site itself collects nothing, because nothing is transmitted from the page. There is no
        analytics, no error reporting, no session recording and no tracking pixel. Vercel Analytics
        and Vercel Speed Insights are specifically not installed &mdash; they are not in the
        project&rsquo;s dependencies and nothing of the kind is loaded by any page. Using a tool
        never tells us your name, your email address, what you converted or that a file existed at
        all. The one exception is the request log our host keeps, which is the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site is served over HTTPS, and every page carries a policy telling your browser it may
        only open connections back to this site. That is a strong extra guard against a mistake in
        our code reaching somebody else&rsquo;s server, rather than a cast-iron guarantee.
      </p>

      <h2>What our host can see</h2>
      <p>
        The pages are served by Vercel, and Vercel&rsquo;s servers record every request they answer:
        your IP address, your browser and device description, the address requested, and the time.
        This is true of every website you visit. On a site with no server code of its own there is
        no way for us to switch it off, so we would rather say so than pretend otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those logs never contain the contents of your files, their names or their sizes &mdash;
        nothing you work on is ever part of a request. One detail is worth knowing: each
        tool&rsquo;s code is downloaded only when somebody opens that tool, so the log does show
        which tool was opened and when.
      </p>
      <p>
        An IP address counts as personal data in many places. The logs are held
        by Vercel under its own privacy policy. We do not use them to build a profile of anyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Third parties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vercel</strong> hosts the site and sits in front of every page, as described
          above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GitHub</strong> is involved only if you click one of our links to the source code
          or the issue tracker, at which point you are on GitHub&rsquo;s site under its rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>{world.provider}</strong> and <strong>{india.provider}</strong> each host a
          contribution page of their own, and each takes the payment on its own page. Neither is
          involved at all unless you choose to contribute. See below.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Third-party code does run in your browser &mdash; the PDF, spreadsheet, image and Markdown
        libraries that do the actual work. All of it is bundled into this site and served from here.
        Nothing is fetched from an outside content network while you use a tool, and no web fonts
        are downloaded: the text you are reading is set in your own system&rsquo;s fonts.
      </p>
      <p>
        One caveat about your own documents. If your Markdown contains an image hosted elsewhere, it
        is blocked while you preview it here. But a web page you export and save has no such
        protection, so opening that saved file later will fetch the image from wherever you pointed
        it.
      </p>

      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing on Docsphin is for sale, and no feature is unlocked by paying. A contribution is a
        voluntary gift towards the time this takes. It buys nothing and unlocks nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no payment widget on this site and no payment code in any page. If you choose to
        contribute, you follow a link out to a page the payment company hosts itself, and everything
        after that happens away from here. That is deliberate: no payment script ever runs on a page
        that is handling your files.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two such links, because no one company reaches everybody. {world.provider} is for
        contributors {world.who}, and you pay in US dollars. {india.provider} is for contributors in{' '}
        {india.who}, and you pay in rupees. Each is one company doing both jobs: it hosts the page
        and it takes the money. You type the amount in yourself, and neither route converts your
        currency for you. Each company holds what it collects under its own privacy policy:{' '}
        <a href={world.privacyUrl} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          {world.provider}
        </a>{' '}
        and{' '}
        <a href={india.privacyUrl} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          {india.provider}
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        We never see or store card or bank details. On the {india.provider} page you type an
        amount and may leave a short note if you want to; {india.provider} then asks for whatever it
        needs to take the payment. On {world.provider} the same applies. From either we can see the
        amount, the date, whether the payment went through, any note you left, and whatever contact
        details that company passes on to us, and we can export that list. We use it only to answer
        a question about a contribution or to make a refund, which goes back through whichever
        company took the payment, to however you paid. We do not add you to any mailing list.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        The tools are suitable for anyone, and there is no account to create. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from a child; the only personal details that ever reach us
        are whatever {india.provider} or {world.provider} passes on about a payment.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        If the site changes in a way that affects this page, we will change the page and the date at
        the top of it. Every previous version is in the project&rsquo;s public commit history, so
        you can see exactly what changed and when.
      </p>

      <h2>Asking a question</h2>
      {contactEmailConfigured ? (
        <p>
          Email <a href={`mailto:${business.email}`}>{business.email}</a> and we will answer.
        </p>

          and we will answer there.

      <p>
        Docsphin is open source under the MIT licence. Every claim on this page can be checked
