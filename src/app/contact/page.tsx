      <p>
        Docsphin is built and maintained by {author.name}, an independent software developer. It
        is a one-person project, so every message is read by the same person who writes the code.

      <h2>GitHub issue tracker</h2>
      <p>
        Docsphin is open source, and its issue tracker is open to everyone. This is the best place
        for anything to do with the software itself:{' '}
        <a href={`${site.repo}/issues`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          {site.repo}/issues
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Issues there are public, so anyone can read them. Please do not attach a file you would not
        want other people to see, and do not post payment details of any kind.
      </p>

      <h2>Which route to use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A tool is broken, or you want a new feature.</strong> Use the issue tracker.
          Telling us the browser you used and what you were trying to do is usually enough to fix
          it.
        </li>
        {contactEmailConfigured ? (
          <li>
            <strong>Anything about a contribution.</strong> Email us. That covers a payment that did
            not go through, a duplicate charge, a receipt, or a refund request &mdash; see the{' '}
            <Link href="/refunds">Refunds page</Link> for what happens next.

        {!contactEmailConfigured && contactPhoneConfigured ? (

        <li>
          <strong>A question about privacy, or about what a tool does with your file.</strong> The{' '}
          <Link href="/privacy">Privacy page</Link> answers most of these in detail. If it does not
          answer yours, ask on the issue tracker.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>There is no account, so there is nothing to recover</h2>
      <p>
        Docsphin has no sign-up, no login and no password. That means there is no account to
        recover, no subscription to cancel and no login support for us to provide. If a tool stops
        working for you, it is a bug in the software rather than a problem with your account, and
        the issue tracker is the right place for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also cannot help you recover a file. Your files are never uploaded, so we never hold a
        copy of anything you have worked on.
      </p>
